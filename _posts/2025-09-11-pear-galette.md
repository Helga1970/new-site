    1. **GALETTE DOUGH:** In a food processor or a bowl, toss together the flour, sugar and salt. Pulse or cut in the butter until the mixture is crumbly. Beat the egg with the milk in a measuring cup. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the egg mixture over the flour mixture and pulse or stir it in with a fork (reserve the remainder). Gather the dough into a smooth mass, pat into a 5-inch disk, and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.
    2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 9½-inch circle. Transfer the dough to a lightly buttered baking sheet. Fold in about ¼ inch of the dough all around, forming a neat rim. With the back of a knife, score decorative diagonal indentations around the rim. Brush the rim with a little of the reserved beaten egg. Brush 1 tablespoon of the apricot preserves over the bottom of the tart shell. Refrigerate while you prepare the pears.
    3. **PEARS:** Peel, quarter and core the pears. Slice each quarter lengthwise into 5 thin wedges. Arrange all but about 6 of the pear slices on the dough in a spoke pattern, overlapping them slightly. Trim the remaining slices and arrange them in the center of the tart.
    4. Gently brush the pear slices with the melted butter and sprinkle with the sugar. Bake until the dough is crisp and golden and the pears are tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
    5. Thin the remaining 1 tablespoon of the apricot preserves with about ½ teaspoon hot water and brush over the pear slices. Serve the galette warm, cutting it into large wedges and topping with a little ice cream, whipped cream or crème fraîche, if you like.

A galette is a rustic French country dessert, less formal than the precisely fluted tart. This one is an adaptation of a superb recipe from Diana Sturgis, test kitchen director at Food & Wine magazine.

The fruit is arranged atop a flat round of pastry, which is formed directly on a baking sheet. Because galettes are baked freeform, you can make them in any shape you like. Bake the galette shortly before serving dinner (not more than a couple of hours ahead, if possible), and then rewarm slightly just before serving.

Glazed with a pinwheel of sheer pear slices, this one is nothing short of heavenly, especially if you serve it warm, with a chilled dessert wine. Make it for a gathering of close friends—there’s something communal about cutting big wedges from the huge round on a big wooden board.
